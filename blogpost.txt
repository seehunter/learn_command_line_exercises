Here is the start of the future blog post.
It will need to be in markdown format I think.

1) Create a repo locally, then push it to github

2) Create a github repo, then clone it locally
==============================================

1:	mkdir <new repo>
	cd <new repo>
	git status

git status
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

	git init
	<add, create, files, dirs>
	git add <file or dir>
	git commit -m "this is what I changed.."
	git push

git push
fatal: No configured push destination.

	git remote add origin git@github.com....
	git push -u origin master
	<more changes, adds, commits>
	git push

this fails miserably if a Readme is present on
remote GitHub origin and on local branch. Once
the remote Readme is removed, then you must undo 
the damage and redo the push to align with origin
master branch on the remote Github..

	git remote rm origin
	git remote add origin <ssh url>
	git push -u origin master

all is happy now and future pushes from within
the local branch may simply be:

	git push

make some changes, add them, commit them

	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "here is what I added"
	git status

On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean

	git push    or...
	git push -u origin master
	git status
